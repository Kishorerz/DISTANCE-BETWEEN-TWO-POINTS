# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: 
start the program
### Step 2: 
import math library from python
### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](https://github.com/Kishorerz/DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS/assets/144451216/d5c8c550-f92f-482e-af02-3b99968e969c)
### Step 4: 
using math.sqrt function 
### Step 5: 
end the program
### PROGRAM:
  ```

import math
p1=[4,2]
p2=[10,6]
d= math.sqrt(((p1[0]-p2[0])**2)+((p1[1]-p2[1])**2))
print('{:.2f}'.format(d))
  
  ```


### OUTPUT:
![output](https://github.com/Kishorerz/DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS/assets/144451216/3d272c3a-5ed9-4d01-9b2e-600f7f7953df)


### RESULT:
thus the  DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINT  are successfully executed
